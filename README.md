This is a fork of [Ulauncher-System](https://github.com/iboyperson/ulauncher-system)!
Now XFCE suspends, hibernates, reboots, ... with --fast -> Session isn't saved

# Original README.md:

## Ulauncher-System

This is a extension for [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) that allows you to:

* Lock
* Log Off
* Suspend
* Hibernate
* Reboot
* Shutdown

### What sets it appart?

* It will attempt to work nicely with the Desktop Environment of you choice. Below are the currently supported DEs.
  If one of these is not detected default commands will be used if possible.
  * GNOME Based (Unity, Gnome, Etc.)
  * KDE
  * Cinnamon
  * Mate
  * XFCE
* It uses the system icon theme for all but its required icon.
* More in the future!
